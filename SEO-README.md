# SEO Optimization Guide for Vibe Coding

## Overview

This document provides information about the SEO optimization implemented for the Vibe Coding portfolio website. The optimization includes a sitemap, robots.txt, and structured data to help improve ranking on Google and Google AI search engines.

## Implemented SEO Features

### 1. Sitemap.xml

A sitemap has been created to help search engines discover and index all pages of the website. The sitemap is located at:

```
/public/sitemap.xml
```

The sitemap is automatically generated during the build process using the script at:

```
/scripts/generate-sitemap.js
```

### 2. Robots.txt

A robots.txt file has been added to guide search engines on how to crawl the site. The file is located at:

```
/public/robots.txt
```

### 3. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Structured data has been implemented using JSON-LD to provide search engines with detailed information about the website. The structured data is defined in:

```
/src/app/structured-data.tsx
```

And is included in the website's `<head>` section in:

```
/src/app/layout.tsx
```

## How to Update

### Updating the Sitemap

The sitemap is automatically generated during the build process. If you need to update it manually, you can run:

```

To add new pages to the sitemap, edit the `routes` array in `/scripts/generate-sitemap.js`.

To update the structured data, edit the `websiteSchema` and `portfolioSchema` objects in `/src/app/structured-data.tsx`.
